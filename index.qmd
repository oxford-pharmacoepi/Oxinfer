## Introduction

This website covers the basis to know what is the Oxinfer group working on and which are the crucial concepts one must know when you start to work with us.

This book starts with an overall description of the team, its aim and scope, and its members in @sec-team. It is particularly interesting to know about the members of our team and how to work with them.

The next 3 chapters provide the basis of our work:

-   Epidemiology (@sec-epi).

-   The OMOP Common Data Model (@sec-omop).

-   R (@sec-R)

These 3 chapters cover resources and basic knowledge that you can skip if you are familiar with.

Finally, the last chapter (@sec-checklist) provides a checklist of all the steps that you need to follow to be onboarded to the group.
