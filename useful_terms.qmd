# Useful terms and terminologies

Sometimes we can use words interchangeably which can cause confusion so below are some terms we use a lot in the team and what they mean and synonyms.

-   **CDM** (Common Data Model)

A common data model is a standard that defines a common language. If people use this common language for their databases this means data can be harmonized. Think of it like a foreign plug adaptor, which turns data into one format. What this means is all databases are in the same format we can run the same code without writing bespoke code for each database we want to use for a study.

-   **OMOP** (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)

OMOP CDM is an open community data standard, designed to standardize the structure and content of observational data and to enable efficient analyses that can produce reliable evidence. In simple terms it is a type of common data model people could use.

-   **OHDSI** (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics)

This is a program which is a global collaborative program to bring out the value of health data through large-scale analytics. Includes academia and industry. People in this collaboration use the OMOP CDM. More information [here](https://ohdsi.org/who-we-are/). **Note**: We lead the OHDSI UK hub.

-   **Data partner** This is the term we use for a database source usually this is a person/s responsible for executing the analytical code.

-   **DARWIN** The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Medicines Regulatory Network established a coordination centre to provide timely and reliable evidence on the use, safety and effectiveness of medicines for human use, including vaccines, from real world healthcare databases across the European Union (EU). This capability is called the Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network (DARWIN EUÂ®). Dani is a deputy director. **Note** We lead and participate in studies that are requested by EMA. Furthermore, we develop R code and packages that are used in this project. More information [here](https://www.darwin-eu.org/).
