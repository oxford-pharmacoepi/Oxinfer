## Real Word Data

All our studies are done with what its is called Real World Data (RWD). It refers to data collected from various sources outside of traditional clinical trials. It encompasses information about the health status, treatment, and outcomes of patients in real-world settings.

1. **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**: Data collected from healthcare providers during routine clinical care, including patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. The most common one that 

2. **Claims and Billing Activities**: Information from health insurance claims, which includes data on patient visits, procedures, medications, and costs.

3. **Registries**: Databases that collect information on patients with specific diseases or conditions, often maintained by healthcare organizations, professional societies, or government agencies.

4. **Patient-Generated Data**: Data provided directly by patients, such as through surveys, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and wearable devices.

5. **Pharmacy Data**: Information from pharmacies regarding prescription medications, including dispensation records and adherence data.

6. **Social Media and Online Platforms**: Health-related information shared by patients and caregivers on social media, forums, and other online platforms.

7. **Mobile Health (mHealth) Data**: Data collected from mobile apps and devices used by patients to monitor their health and wellness.

### Uses of Real World Data

1. **Regulatory Decision Making**: Regulatory agencies, like the FDA, use RWD to support approval of new treatments, label expansions, and post-market surveillance.

2. **Clinical Decision Support**: RWD helps healthcare providers make more informed decisions about patient care by providing insights into treatment effectiveness and safety in broader populations.

3. **Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR)**: RWD is used to assess the cost-effectiveness and value of medical interventions.

4. **Epidemiology**: RWD aids in understanding the prevalence, incidence, and burden of diseases in the population.

5. **Comparative Effectiveness Research**: Researchers use RWD to compare the effectiveness of different treatments in real-world settings.

6. **Pharmacovigilance**: RWD is crucial for monitoring the safety of medications post-approval to identify and mitigate adverse effects.

### Challenges with Real World Data

1. **Data Quality**: Inconsistencies, missing information, and variations in data collection methods can affect the reliability of RWD.

2. **Data Integration**: Combining data from diverse sources can be complex due to differences in formats, standards, and terminologies.

3. **Privacy and Security**: Ensuring patient confidentiality and data security is paramount when handling RWD.

4. **Bias and Confounding**: Real-world studies may be subject to biases and confounders that can impact the validity of findings.

### Real World Evidence

We call the evidence generated by RWD as Real World Evidence, in most of our studies this

## Why a Common Data Model?

Using a common data model (CDM) is crucial for standardizing and harmonizing data from disparate sources, ensuring consistency and interoperability. A CDM facilitates the integration and analysis of data from various healthcare systems, electronic health records, claims databases, and patient registries by providing a unified structure and standardized terminologies. This standardization enables researchers and healthcare professionals to perform meaningful comparisons, aggregate data efficiently, and derive robust, generalizable insights. Additionally, a CDM enhances data quality and reliability, reduces the potential for errors, and supports regulatory compliance and collaborative research efforts. Ultimately, adopting a common data model accelerates the translation of real-world data into actionable knowledge, improving patient outcomes and advancing medical research.
