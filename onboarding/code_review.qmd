# Code Review {#sec-code_review}

Some useful text here to explain who and what and when this should be done.. TBC

1)  Basic checks:

-   Code is on github
-   Study is organised as an R project
-   Renv is used to list all dependencies needed
-   Study code has a clear logical flow, with any particularly long scripts split up into separate files
-   Study code doesn't have a lot of complex, custom code (that should be in a package with tests)
-   The code runs on a 100k dataset without error
-   How are the results visualised and reported?
-   Is there a shiny to go with the study code?
-   Review results for plausibility

2.  Check whether the code does what is intended:

-   Does the code match the protocol?
-   Have any analyses been missed?
-   For each analysis, are cohorts defined in the right way (e.g. typically no exclusion criteria for an incidence outcome) - this has been the most common source of issues

3.  Check whether the code can be optimised:

-   Is any code repeated unnecessarily?
-   Can code be simplified?
-   Review the sql that gets executed for any obvious inefficiencies
