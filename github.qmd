# Github

## What is github?

Github is a version control platform that allows users from all over the world to build software collaboratively.

Github is organised in different *repositories* where we can work collaboratively.

The main benefits that github has is that is free, a way to store your code and have version control of it.

We will use github for three different purposes:

1. Develop study code in a collaborative way. Multiple users will contribute to the same repo. This repositories will be usually kept as `private` so we will have to give them access to the individuals that can edit it.

2. Share study code for a network

If you don't have a github account you can create one at <github.com>

## Final remarks

::: {.callout-important}
It is very important that we do not commit to github:
- **personal information**
- **study results**
- **database credentials**

Keep in mind that after you push some changes in a github repo, even if you delete them later those changes will remain in the commit history.
