# Our Team

Welcome to the team! Below is some useful information and links about getting help with certain aspects of your role. You can check out our website where you can put names to faces here.

Although you might be in a certain team within the group we constantly work with people in other teams. This is why we provide training on both the epidemiology and data science to give everyone a well-rounded understanding to produce world leading research ðŸ˜Š. As you can see Dani leads the group with Ed, Annika, Mahki, Trishna and Antonella leading specific teams/themes in the team.
