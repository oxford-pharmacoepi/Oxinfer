Although you might be in a certain team within the group we constantly work with people in other teams. This is why we provide training on both the epidemiology and data science to give everyone a well-rounded understanding to produce world leading research ðŸ˜Š. As you can see in the organagram below Dani leads the group with Ed, Annika, Mahki, Trishna and Antonella leading specific teams/themes in the team.
