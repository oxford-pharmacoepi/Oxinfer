    "text": "Oxford distributed analytics for network research group (oxinfer) is a research group at the University of Oxford with three key purposes:\n\n\n\nOxinfer is part of the wider Health Data Sciences section (lead by Prof. Daniel Prieto-Alhambra)\nWelcome to the team! Below is some useful information and links about getting help with certain aspects of your role. You can check out our website where you can put names to faces [here].\nhttps://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/edward-burn\n\n\n\nOur Team Dec 23\n\n\n\n\n\nscope of the team … TBC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Researcher in Epidemiology and Health Economics\n\nMy research is focused on using routinely collected health care data to inform medical decision making. With careful curation and analysis, the data from millions of routinely recorded health care interactions can be used to generate evidence on patient prognosis and the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of medicines and procedures.\n\n\nThe foundation of my current research is the use of a common data model to transform disparate sources of health care data into a standard format. This then allows for data analyses to be performed across a distributed network of data partners, with only analytic code and aggregated results sets shared between sites. This approach has already facilitated a number of network studies, ranging from a comparison of alternative approaches to knee replacement in the UK and US to an early description of the people being hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US, South Korea, and Spain.\n\n\nI have been contributing to the European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN) project and am an active member of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. More recently, I have been leading analyses for projects funded by the European Medicines Agency to assess outcomes among patients with COVID-19 and to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\n\n\nMedical Statistician/Data Scientist\n\nI am a postdoctoral data scientist using routinely collected health data to generate reliable evidence for improved patient care. I work within the Pharmaco- and Device Epidemiology group at the Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM).\n\n\nMy research focuses on generating evidence on the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of medicines and procedures. To do so, I develop R packages and code to curate and analyse the data from millions of routinely recorded health care interactions. We use a common data model developed by the OHDSI community to transform disparate sources of healthcare data, into a standard format. Our data partners across Europe and the world all transform their data into this format. We can then perform data analyses across all these datasets, sharing only analytic code and aggregated results between sites. This approach allows us to safely combine data and generate more generalisable answers to research questions than if we were restricted to single datasets. \n\n\nI also contribute to the DARWIN EU project as a programmer and study leader. This European Medicines Agency project will deliver real-world evidence from across Europe on diseases, populations, and the use and performance of medicines. \n\n\nBefore joining CSM, I completed my PhD thesis in Computational and Applied Physics at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona. There I built computational models to understand the natural history of tuberculosis. I also built computational models to predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, which were used by the Catalan authorities and European Commission (DG-Connect).\n\n\n\n\nSenior Postdoctoral Researcher in Real World Evidence\n\nI joined NDORMS in April 2022 from the Department of Psychiatry where I led projects related to drug repurposing and understanding risk factors of dementia as well as other mental health and neurological conditions. I have a multidisciplinary background in epidemiology, pharmacology, and machine learning. My complete publication list can be found here.\n\n\nMy main research interests involve triangulating real world evidence from multiple sources such as medical records and genetic data to understand more about what causes certain diseases, how they have changed over time and what we can do to intervene with new or existing interventions and the safety of these interventions. \n\n\nSpecific areas of interest and expertise:\n\n\n\nDescriptive epidemiology for oncology\n\n\nFederated network studies for cancer survival\n\n\nSignal detection for drug safety\n\n\nDrug target Mendelian randomization\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher in Health Data Sciences\n   \n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher in Health Data Sciences\n   \n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Data Scientist\n\nI joined NDORMS in October 2022 as an Epidemiologist and Postdoctoral Data Scientist. My main research interest is observational research on the topic of musculoskeletal diseases with a focus on autoimmune rheumatic diseases.\n\n\nIn this current position, I developed a perinatal extension table diagnostics R package for the European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN) and further diagnostics packages will follow for DARWIN EU CC.\n\n\nPrior to my current position, I worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich where I used the Swiss Rheumatology registry for my research on rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and did a research visit at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm using Swedish nationwide registries to assess various (musculoskeletal) outcomes following bariatric surgery.\n\n\nI obtained a pharmacist degree in Switzerland in 2012 and worked as a community pharmacist and in a pharmaceutical company until 2015, when I joined the Basel PharmacoEpidemiologyUnit for my PhD training. \n\n\nORCID: 0000-0003-1313-4473\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assistant in Health Data Sciences\n\nI am a Research Assistant in Health Data Science at University of Oxford, the projects that I am currently working on include EHDEN Parkinsonism study and UCB Re-fracture study. My key responsibility is to programme and design analytical pipelines in R to answer healthcare research questions. Before that I have completed my Master’s degree in Mathematics from University of Oxford.\n\n\n\n\nDPhil student\n\nI am a DPhil student working on leveraging real world data to characterise the long-term impact of COVID-19.

    "text": "Senior Researcher in Epidemiology and Health Economics\n\nMy research is focused on using routinely collected health care data to inform medical decision making. With careful curation and analysis, the data from millions of routinely recorded health care interactions can be used to generate evidence on patient prognosis and the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of medicines and procedures.\n\n\nThe foundation of my current research is the use of a common data model to transform disparate sources of health care data into a standard format. This then allows for data analyses to be performed across a distributed network of data partners, with only analytic code and aggregated results sets shared between sites. This approach has already facilitated a number of network studies, ranging from a comparison of alternative approaches to knee replacement in the UK and US to an early description of the people being hospitalised with COVID-19 in the US, South Korea, and Spain.\n\n\nI have been contributing to the European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN) project and am an active member of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. More recently, I have been leading analyses for projects funded by the European Medicines Agency to assess outcomes among patients with COVID-19 and to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\n\n\nMedical Statistician/Data Scientist\n\nI am a postdoctoral data scientist using routinely collected health data to generate reliable evidence for improved patient care. I work within the Pharmaco- and Device Epidemiology group at the Centre for Statistics in Medicine (CSM).\n\n\nMy research focuses on generating evidence on the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of medicines and procedures. To do so, I develop R packages and code to curate and analyse the data from millions of routinely recorded health care interactions. We use a common data model developed by the OHDSI community to transform disparate sources of healthcare data, into a standard format. Our data partners across Europe and the world all transform their data into this format. We can then perform data analyses across all these datasets, sharing only analytic code and aggregated results between sites. This approach allows us to safely combine data and generate more generalisable answers to research questions than if we were restricted to single datasets. \n\n\nI also contribute to the DARWIN EU project as a programmer and study leader. This European Medicines Agency project will deliver real-world evidence from across Europe on diseases, populations, and the use and performance of medicines. \n\n\nBefore joining CSM, I completed my PhD thesis in Computational and Applied Physics at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Barcelona. There I built computational models to understand the natural history of tuberculosis. I also built computational models to predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, which were used by the Catalan authorities and European Commission (DG-Connect).\n\n\n\n\nSenior Postdoctoral Researcher in Real World Evidence\n\nI joined NDORMS in April 2022 from the Department of Psychiatry where I led projects related to drug repurposing and understanding risk factors of dementia as well as other mental health and neurological conditions. I have a multidisciplinary background in epidemiology, pharmacology, and machine learning. My complete publication list can be found here.\n\n\nMy main research interests involve triangulating real world evidence from multiple sources such as medical records and genetic data to understand more about what causes certain diseases, how they have changed over time and what we can do to intervene with new or existing interventions and the safety of these interventions. \n\n\nSpecific areas of interest and expertise:\n\n\n\nDescriptive epidemiology for oncology\n\n\nFederated network studies for cancer survival\n\n\nSignal detection for drug safety\n\n\nDrug target Mendelian randomization\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher in Health Data Sciences\n   \n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher in Health Data Sciences\n   \n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Data Scientist\n\nI joined NDORMS in October 2022 as an Epidemiologist and Postdoctoral Data Scientist. My main research interest is observational research on the topic of musculoskeletal diseases with a focus on autoimmune rheumatic diseases.\n\n\nIn this current position, I developed a perinatal extension table diagnostics R package for the European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN) and further diagnostics packages will follow for DARWIN EU CC.\n\n\nPrior to my current position, I worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich where I used the Swiss Rheumatology registry for my research on rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and did a research visit at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm using Swedish nationwide registries to assess various (musculoskeletal) outcomes following bariatric surgery.\n\n\nI obtained a pharmacist degree in Switzerland in 2012 and worked as a community pharmacist and in a pharmaceutical company until 2015, when I joined the Basel PharmacoEpidemiologyUnit for my PhD training. \n\n\nORCID: 0000-0003-1313-4473\n\n\n\n\nResearch Assistant in Health Data Sciences\n\nI am a Research Assistant in Health Data Science at University of Oxford, the projects that I am currently working on include EHDEN Parkinsonism study and UCB Re-fracture study. My key responsibility is to programme and design analytical pipelines in R to answer healthcare research questions. Before that I have completed my Master’s degree in Mathematics from University of Oxford.\n\n\n\n\nDPhil student\n\nI am a DPhil student working on leveraging real world data to characterise the long-term impact of COVID-19. I use routinely collected primary care health data mapped to a common data model which allows me to work with other partners across the world to produce better evidence. I work on profiling, phenotyping and also applying different statistical models and analyses to study COVID-19, in particular its long-term effects.

    "text": "New to the OMOP CDM? We’d recommend you pare this book with The Book of OHDSI\n\n\nAll our studies are done with what it is called Real World Data (RWD). It refers to data collected from various sources outside of traditional clinical trials. It encompasses information about the health status, treatment, and outcomes of patients in real-world settings.\nFor example, the most common source that we use is Electronic Health Records (EHRs): Data collected from healthcare providers during routine clinical care, including patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes.\nThere exist also other sources of RWD: Claims and Billing Activities (from health insurance claims), Registries (databases that collect information on patients with specific diseases or conditions), Pharmacy Data (prescription medications), among others…\n\n\nRWD can be used in many different ways:\n\nRegulatory Decision Making: Regulatory agencies, like the FDA, use RWD to support approval of new treatments, label expansions, and post-market surveillance.\nClinical Decision Support: RWD helps healthcare providers make more informed decisions about patient care by providing insights into treatment effectiveness and safety in broader populations.\nHealth Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR): RWD is used to assess the cost-effectiveness and value of medical interventions.\nEpidemiology: RWD aids in understanding the prevalence, incidence, and burden of diseases in the population.\nComparative Effectiveness Research: Researchers use RWD to compare the effectiveness of different treatments in real-world settings.\nPharmacovigilance: RWD is crucial for monitoring the safety of medications post-approval to identify and mitigate adverse effects.\n\n\n\n\nWhen working with RWD we have to be aware of some challenges and limitations:\n\nData Quality: Inconsistencies, missing information, and variations in data collection methods can affect the reliability of RWD.\nData Integration: Combining data from diverse sources can be complex due to differences in formats, standards, and terminologies.\nPrivacy and Security: Ensuring patient confidentiality and data security is paramount when handling RWD.\nBias and Confounding: Real-world studies may be subject to biases and confounders that can impact the validity of findings.\n\n\n\n\nWe call the evidence generated by RWD as Real World Evidence. This will be our end goal, to generate reliable Real World Evidence in a transparent and fast way.\n\n\n\n\nAs we have just seen RWD can come from many different sources and it is usually not collected for research purposes. This leads to diverse structures, coding systems and can become quite a nightmare to reproduce an study in different databases. This is why common data models started gaining popularity.\nUsing a common data model (CDM) is crucial for standardising and harmonising data from disparate sources, ensuring consistency and interoperability. A CDM facilitates the integration and analysis of data from various healthcare systems by providing a unified structure and standardised terminologies. This standardisation enables researchers and healthcare professionals to perform meaningful comparisons, aggregate data efficiently, and derive robust, generalisable insights. Additionally, a CDM enhances data quality and reliability, reduces the potential for errors, and supports regulatory compliance and collaborative research efforts. Ultimately, adopting a common data model accelerates the translation of real-world data into actionable knowledge, improving patient outcomes and advancing medical research.\n\n\n\nThe Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) is a common data model for organising healthcare data from various sources. It is ones of the most popular growing CDM world wide with more than 800 million patients’ health care data transformed into this format.\nThe OMOP CDM is a person-centric relational data model. Patients’ data is spread across various tables related to different clinical domains with, for example, the condition occurrence table containing diagnoses while the drug exposure table contains drug prescriptions. These different clinical tables are all linked back to the person table which contains a unique identifier for each individual along with some key demographic data such as their date of birth. Meanwhile, records in the observation period table define the period of calendar time over which an individual is followed-up.\nIn this figure you can see the different tables that exist in the OMOP CDM and how are they related:\n\n\n\n\nThe OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) community is a global, multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary collaborative that aims to improve health by empowering the community to collaboratively generate evidence that promotes better health decisions and better care.\n\nThe primary mission is to create a research community that produces high-quality, reproducible, and reliable evidence about health and healthcare.\nA key component of OHDSI’s infrastructure is the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model.\nOHDSI emphasizes open science principles, making their tools, methods, and research findings freely available to the public though their github: https://github.com/ohdsi.\nAnnual symposiums and other events foster collaboration and the sharing of ideas within the community.\n\nYou can find more about ohdsi community on their website: https://ohdsi.org.\n\n\n\nThe Ehden Academy is an educational initiative that contains lots of resources on the basis of OMOP and how the OMOP CDM is structured, its vocabularies and so…\nIn particular we would recommend these courses:\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThat’s a brief introduction to a very complicated topic, please refer to the provided links to learn more and get a more in depth view.\n\n\nEvery record in a RWD database gets coded into a numeric identifier (code), there exist many different Medical Classifications that are different vocabularies. Each vocabulary has its pros and its cons. Each database generally will come with a different vocabulary. OMOP CDM has some standard vicabularies that are the ones commonly used. In general this vocabulary will be different to the source one (originl of your data).\nWe call mapping to the process to convert a source data (original format of the data) that can be in many different formats to the OMOP CDM. In our team Antonella and Teen are the ones in charge of the mapping process.\nAthena contains the last version of the vocabularies and it is used to track its changes. You can use athena to search for OMOP concepts and see how they are related.\n\n\n\nThis was a very general introduction to the OMOP CDM as there are many resources out there that can help you to familiarise with OMOP. We recomend to take a look to The Book of OHDSI and the recommended courses from Ehden Academy, but the best way to learn about OMOP is to do an study with one of our OMOP instances, learning by doing :).",

It encompasses information about the health status, treatment, and outcomes of patients in real-world settings.\nFor example, the most common source that we use is Electronic Health Records (EHRs): Data collected from healthcare providers during routine clinical care, including patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes.\nThere exist also other sources of RWD: Claims and Billing Activities (from health insurance claims), Registries (databases that collect information on patients with specific diseases or conditions), Pharmacy Data (prescription medications), among others…\n\n\nRWD can be used in many different ways:\n\nRegulatory Decision Making: Regulatory agencies, like the FDA, use RWD to support approval of new treatments, label expansions, and post-market surveillance.\nClinical Decision Support: RWD helps healthcare providers make more informed decisions about patient care by providing insights into treatment effectiveness and safety in broader populations.\nHealth Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR): RWD is used to assess the cost-effectiveness and value of medical interventions.\nEpidemiology: RWD aids in understanding the prevalence, incidence, and burden of diseases in the population.\nComparative Effectiveness Research: Researchers use RWD to compare the effectiveness of different treatments in real-world settings.\nPharmacovigilance: RWD is crucial for monitoring the safety of medications post-approval to identify and mitigate adverse effects.\n\n\n\n\nWhen working with RWD we have to be aware of some challenges and limitations:\n\nData Quality: Inconsistencies, missing information, and variations in data collection methods can affect the reliability of RWD.\nData Integration: Combining data from diverse sources can be complex due to differences in formats, standards, and terminologies.\nPrivacy and Security: Ensuring patient confidentiality and data security is paramount when handling RWD.\nBias and Confounding: Real-world studies may be subject to biases and confounders that can impact the validity of findings.\n\n\n\n\nWe call the evidence generated by RWD as Real World Evidence. This will be our end goal, to generate reliable Real World Evidence in a transparent and fast way.",

    "text": "As we have just seen RWD can come from many different sources and it is usually not collected for research purposes. This leads to diverse structures, coding systems and can become quite a nightmare to reproduce an study in different databases. This is why common data models started gaining popularity.\nUsing a common data model (CDM) is crucial for standardising and harmonising data from disparate sources, ensuring consistency and interoperability. A CDM facilitates the integration and analysis of data from various healthcare systems by providing a unified structure and standardised terminologies. This standardisation enables researchers and healthcare professionals to perform meaningful comparisons, aggregate data efficiently, and derive robust, generalisable insights. Additionally, a CDM enhances data quality and reliability, reduces the potential for errors, and supports regulatory compliance and collaborative research efforts. Ultimately, adopting a common data model accelerates the translation of real-world data into actionable knowledge, improving patient outcomes and advancing medical research.",

It is ones of the most popular growing CDM world wide with more than 800 million patients’ health care data transformed into this format.\nThe OMOP CDM is a person-centric relational data model. Patients’ data is spread across various tables related to different clinical domains with, for example, the condition occurrence table containing diagnoses while the drug exposure table contains drug prescriptions. These different clinical tables are all linked back to the person table which contains a unique identifier for each individual along with some key demographic data such as their date of birth. Meanwhile, records in the observation period table define the period of calendar time over which an individual is followed-up.\nIn this figure you can see the different tables that exist in the OMOP CDM and how are they related:",

Each vocabulary has its pros and its cons. Each database generally will come with a different vocabulary. OMOP CDM has some standard vicabularies that are the ones commonly used. In general this vocabulary will be different to the source one (originl of your data).\nWe call mapping to the process to convert a source data (original format of the data) that can be in many different formats to the OMOP CDM. In our team Antonella and Teen are the ones in charge of the mapping process.\nAthena contains the last version of the vocabularies and it is used to track its changes.

The R environ file will help use to do so.\n.Renviron is a file linked to your R session to safely save secrets. It is loaded at the beginning of each session and secrets are kept till the session is terminated or restarted.\nTo access to a secret you can type:\n\nSys.getenv(\"MY_SECRET\")\n\n[1] \"\"\n\n\nAs we have just seen if a secret does not exist the output will be an empty string: \"\".\nYou can set a temporary secret using the following command:\n\nSys.setenv(MY_SECRET = \"123456789\")\n\nThen now if you run the same command than before you will get the value that we have just set back:\n\nSys.getenv(\"MY_SECRET\")\n\n[1] \"123456789\"\n\n\nThis value can be assigned to a variable as we would do as usual:\n\nx &lt;- \"123456789\"\nprint(x)\n\n[1] \"123456789\"\n\n\n\ny &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"MY_SECRET\")\nprint(y)\n\n[1] \"123456789\"\n\n\nAs you can see x and y have the same value but if you share the code in the second case the code would only work if you have the same secret stored in your environment. This is very useful to store the connection details so even if you share your code you would not be share sensitive information.\nThere are two type of secrets:\n\ntemporal (as we have just seen), these secrets only last for while the session is ongoing the moment that you restart or terminate it all the secrets will be gone, so it is not recommended to use temporal secrets.\npermanent (we will see in the next step), these secrets are kept across different sessions and will always be in your environment unless you explicitly delete them. These secrets are stored in the .Renviron file. We will use permanent secrets to store our database credentials.\n\nYou can read more about secrets here.\n*NOTE: you can see all the secrets of your R session running the following command:\n\nSys.getenv()\n\n\n\n\nTo open your .Renviron file you can run the following command:\n\nedit_r_environ()\n\nThere you can write secrets that you want to store\n\nMY_SECRET = \"123456789\"\n\nIt is like writing in the Sys.setenv() function, but these secrets will be permanent and always be loaded in your session.\nSecrets are loaded every time our session starts, so if we modify the .Renviron file and we want the new secrets to be loaded we should restart the R session (Control+Shift+F10).\nTry writing your username, password, port and host there and create a connection with the following code:\n\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(drv = Postgres(),\n                 dbname = \"...\",\n                 host = Sys.getenv(\"HOST\"),\n                 port = Sys.getenv(\"PORT\"),\n                 user = Sys.getenv(\"USER\"),\n                 password = Sys.getenv(\"PASSWORD\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nYOU MUST NEVER INCLUDE CONNECTION DETAILS IN A SCRIPT THAT IS PUBLIC OR YOU SHARE WITH SOMEONE, EVEN IF YOU TRUST THAT PERSON OR IS IN THE SAME ORGANIZATION.",

It is loaded at the beginning of each session and secrets are kept till the session is terminated or restarted.\nTo access to a secret you can type:\n\nSys.getenv(\"MY_SECRET\")\n\n[1] \"\"\n\n\nAs we have just seen if a secret does not exist the output will be an empty string: \"\".\nYou can set a temporary secret using the following command:\n\nSys.setenv(MY_SECRET = \"123456789\")\n\nThen now if you run the same command than before you will get the value that we have just set back:\n\nSys.getenv(\"MY_SECRET\")\n\n[1] \"123456789\"\n\n\nThis value can be assigned to a variable as we would do as usual:\n\nx &lt;- \"123456789\"\nprint(x)\n\n[1] \"123456789\"\n\n\n\ny &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"MY_SECRET\")\nprint(y)\n\n[1] \"123456789\"\n\n\nAs you can see x and y have the same value but if you share the code in the second case the code would only work if you have the same secret stored in your environment. This is very useful to store the connection details so even if you share your code you would not be share sensitive information.\nThere are two type of secrets:\n\ntemporal (as we have just seen), these secrets only last for while the session is ongoing the moment that you restart or terminate it all the secrets will be gone, so it is not recommended to use temporal secrets.\npermanent (we will see in the next step), these secrets are kept across different sessions and will always be in your environment unless you explicitly delete them. These secrets are stored in the .Renviron file. We will use permanent secrets to store our database credentials.\n\nYou can read more about secrets here.\n*NOTE: you can see all the secrets of your R session running the following command:\n\nSys.getenv()\n\n\n\n\nTo open your .Renviron file you can run the following command:\n\nedit_r_environ()\n\nThere you can write secrets that you want to store\n\nMY_SECRET = \"123456789\"\n\nIt is like writing in the Sys.setenv() function, but these secrets will be permanent and always be loaded in your session.\nSecrets are loaded every time our session starts, so if we modify the .Renviron file and we want the new secrets to be loaded we should restart the R session (Control+Shift+F10).\nTry writing your username, password, port and host there and create a connection with the following code:\n\ncon &lt;- dbConnect(drv = Postgres(),\n                 dbname = \"...\",\n                 host = Sys.getenv(\"HOST\"),\n                 port = Sys.getenv(\"PORT\"),\n                 user = Sys.getenv(\"USER\"),\n                 password = Sys.getenv(\"PASSWORD\"))",

    "text": "Useful terms and terminologies\nSometimes we can use words interchangeably which can cause confusion so below are some terms we use a lot in the team and what they mean and synonyms.\n\nNDORMS (Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences).\n\nThis is our department. NDORMS is part of the Medical Sciences Division of the University of Oxford.\n\nBotnar (Botnar Institute for Musculoskeletal Sciences)\n\nThis is where you work (if you dont why are you reading this?!). The research work in the department (NDORMS) takes place across three world-leading research institutes: the Botnar Institute for Musculoskeletal Sciences, the Kennedy Institute for Rheumatology and the Kadoorie Centre.\n\nHDS (Health Data Sciences)\n\nThe Botnar Institute is structured into four academic divisions. From the divisions there are sections. We work under academic section Health Data Sciences.\n\n\n\nBotnar Divisions\n\n\n\nCSM (Centre for Statistics in Medicine)\n\nThe CSM is based at Botnar with an aim to advance healthcare practice and policy that changes lives, through excellent research. Our group is one of the teams as well as others apart of the CSM.\n\nCDM (Common Data Model)\n\nA common data model is a standard that defines a common language. If people use this common language for their databases this means data can be harmonized. Think of it like a foreign plug adaptor, which turns data into one format. What this means is all databases are in the same format we can run the same code without writing bespoke code for each database we want to use for a study.\n\nOMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)\n\nOMOP CDM is an open community data standard, designed to standardize the structure and content of observational data and to enable efficient analyses that can produce reliable evidence. In simple terms it is a type of common data model people could use.\n\nOHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics)\n\nThis is a program which is a global collaborative program to bring out the value of health data through large-scale analytics. Includes academia and industry. People in this collaboration use the OMOP CDM. More information here. Note: We lead the OHDSI UK hub.\n\nData partner\n\nThis is the term we use for a database source usually this is a person/s responsible for executing the analytical code.\n\nIndividual/patient level data\n\nPatient level data. i.e for each patient all the information. We only have access to patient level data for our datasets based within the team. We never have access to patient level data from other data partners.\n\nAggregated level data\n\nAs the name suggests the data only contains aggregated results such as results from a study. Aggregated data from data partners can be shared subject to the protocol and data sharing agreement with data partner.\n\nFederated network studies\n\nWhen the same analytical code is run across multiple databases/data partners across the UK, Europe, Globe etc in one study. Note we only share analytical code with a data partner and they run the code we never have access to individual/patient level data.\n\nEHDEN (European Health Data Evidence Network)\n\nThis is a large consortium with 25 partners operating in Europe. Note We are apart of this consortium and have led and participated in various federated network studies. More information here here.\n\nDARWIN\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Medicines Regulatory Network established a coordination centre to provide timely and reliable evidence on the use, safety and effectiveness of medicines for human use, including vaccines, from real world healthcare databases across the European Union (EU). This capability is called the Data Analysis and Real World Interrogation Network (DARWIN EU®). Dani is a deputy director. Note We lead and participate in studies that are requested by EMA. Furthermore, we develop R code and packages that are used in this project. More information here.\n\nInstantiating\n\nWhen you hear this term it basically means extracting and creating a table containing individuals with specified characteristics for example with a diagnosis of hypertension as a table in the database.",

    "text": "Git is a powerful tool that helps developers manage and track changes in their projects. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without causing conflicts or losing any work. Git keeps a record of every change made, which makes it easy to go back to previous versions if needed. This makes collaboration smoother and ensures that the project evolves in an organized and reliable way.\nGitHub is a web platform built on top of Git where developers can host their projects and collaborate more effectively. It provides a space where people can share their code, discuss issues, and plan their work.\nGithub desktop is a user-friendly way to use git and github interface from an app. You can download it here: https://github.com/apps/desktop. We usually use github desktop to perform commits, push, pull and perform the different github operations. If you are very skilled you can also use git from the terminal.\nIf you are interested to know more you can read it here, you can follow this tutorial.\n\n\n\nWe will use github for three different purposes:\n\nDevelop study code in a collaborative way. Multiple users will contribute to the same repo. This repositories will be usually kept as private so we will have to give them access to the individuals that can edit it.\nShare study code for a network study.\nDevelop an R package in a collaborative way.\n\nIf you don’t have a github account you can create one at https://github.com\n\n\n\n\n\nA repository, often shortened to “repo” is a storage space where your project lives. It can contain files, folders, images, videos, spreadsheets, data sets, and anything else your project needs. A GitHub repository also includes a history of all changes made to the files within it, making it easy to track and manage your project’s development.\n\n\n\nCloning a repository means creating a local copy of a project that is stored on GitHub. This allows you to work on the project on your own machine. To clone a repository, you can use the following steps (Github desktop):\n\nTop left: Add -&gt; Clone Repository…\nprovide user or organization name and the name of the repo that you want to clone separated by “/”. Example: ‘oxford-pharmacoepi/OxinferOnboarding’.\nClone\n\nIf your repo contains an R project you can open it from RStidio and edit there what you want.\n\n\n\nA branch in GitHub is a parallel version of a repository. It diverges from the main working project to work on something without affecting the main branch. Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment safely. For example it is useful if you are working collaboratively to make some changes to a repository without affecting the others and submitting your changes so someone can review them.\nIn general if the repo is for your use only you will always work on the “main” branch. You can switch or create a new branch using the branch tab in Github desktop.\n\n\n\nA commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. When you make changes to files in your repository, you can “commit” those changes, which records them in the repository’s history. Each commit has a unique identifier (a hash), a message describing the changes, and metadata like the author’s name and the timestamp.\nTo create a commit you just have to tick the files that you want to commit, add a message and click commit to create the commit.\nInitially this commit will be only local, you could send it online using push. Then all your changes have been uploaded to the github platform.\n\n\n\n\nPush: When you push changes, you send your committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub. This makes your changes available to others.\nPull: Pulling is the process of fetching updates from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository. This ensures your local repository is up to date with the latest changes made by others.\n\n\n\n\nA pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository. After you’ve made changes in a branch (not main), you can open a pull request to merge those changes into another branch, typically the main branch. Other team members can review, comment, and approve the changes before they are merged.\nBy understanding these fundamental concepts, you can effectively use GitHub to manage your projects and collaborate with others.\n\n\n\nIssues on GitHub are used to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They are a great way to organize and prioritize your work. Each issue can include a title, a detailed description, labels, and comments from collaborators.\nTo create an issue:\n\nGo to the repository on GitHub.\nClick the “Issues” tab.\nClick the “New issue” button.\nFill in the title and description, and submit the issue.\n\nIssues can be assigned to team members, labeled with tags, and linked to pull requests, making them a powerful tool for project management.\n\n\n\nThe .gitignore file is used to specify files and directories that Git should ignore. This is useful for excluding files that are not meant to be tracked, such as temporary files, build outputs, and sensitive information.\nTo create and use a .gitignore file:\n\nCreate a file named .gitignore in the root of your repository.\nAdd the files and directories you want to ignore. For example:\n\n\n# Ignore all .csv files\n*.csv\n   \n# Ignore the Results directory\nResults/\n   \n# Ignore sensitive files (in this case)\nconnectToDatabase.R\n\nBy using a .gitignore file, you can keep your repository clean and free of unnecessary files, ensuring that only relevant files are tracked and shared.\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure your github account in your RStudio session so it is easier to use it. This is mainly recommended when you can not use github desktop (e.g. on the server).\nYou can learn how to configure git and github in Rstudio following this tutorial.\n\n\nIn general you can install an R package from github using devtools or remotes package:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"darwin-eu/CDMConnector\")\n\nSometimes we keep the development of some packages private, so we can include mentions of specific studies or keep the issues private. For example there exist a private version of CDMConnector in darwin-eu-dev, if you try to install it you would get the following error:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"darwin-eu-dev/CDMConnector\")\n\nUsing github PAT from envvar GITHUB_TOKEN. Use `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` and unset GITHUB_TOKEN in .Renviron (or elsewhere) if you want to use the more secure git credential store instead.\n\n\nError: Failed to install 'CDMConnector' from GitHub:\n  HTTP error 404.\n  Not Found\n\n  Did you spell the repo owner (`darwin-eu-dev`) and repo name (`CDMConnector`) correctly?\n  - If spelling is correct, check that you have the required permissions to access the repo.\n\n\nSo you can install private packages (that you have access to) you need to set up the GITHUB_PAT. You can set it up with the following steps:\n\nLog in to github and go to the tokens section: https://github.com/settings/tokens.\nSelect the option: Generate new token (classic) (it is in the top-right dropdown menu Generate new token -&gt; Generate new token (classic)).\nAdd a note so you know what is this token for and tick at least the following box: repo; and click on Generate token.\nCopy the token (it should be a combination of letters and numbers that starts with ghp_...).\nSet a new .Renviron variable called GITHUB_PAT.\n\n\nusethis::edit_r_environ()\n# write there\nGITHUB_PAT = \"ghp_...\"\n\n\nRestart your R session.\n\nNow you should be able to install the private repo (if you have access to it):\n\nremotes::install_github(\"darwin-eu-dev/CDMConnector\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is very important that we do not commit to github: - personal information - study results - database credentials\nKeep in mind that after you push some changes in a github repo, even if you delete them later those changes will remain in the commit history.",
